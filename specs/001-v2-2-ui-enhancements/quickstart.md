# Quickstart: Verifying Phase 1 — Shared Foundation

Scope: exactly 4 items. No page migrates to consume them in this slice, so verify in isolation.
No test framework exists in this repo — this is manual, plus `npm run lint`/`npm run build`.

## 1. Ghost button (`Button.tsx`)

1. Temporarily render `<Button variant="ghost">Test</Button>` anywhere (scratch page/sandbox).
2. Confirm the white-gradient fill, visible top inset highlight, and on hover: ~2px lift (no background/border brighten — deliberately lift-only, see research.md §1).
3. Confirm `primary`/`outline` variants are unchanged.
4. Confirm `about-us-hero.tsx`/`services-hero.tsx` (still on `.btn-ghost`) are visually unchanged —
   this slice must not touch them.

## 2. Eyebrow (`SectionEyebrow`)

1. Render `<SectionEyebrow>Test</SectionEyebrow>` — dash present (default unchanged).
2. Render `<SectionEyebrow showAccent={false}>Test</SectionEyebrow>` — no dash, no layout shift.
3. Confirm all 12 existing call sites (About, Construction, Services) are pixel-unchanged.

## 3. `FilterBar`

1. Mount `<FilterBar>` with a few chip children in a scratch page.
2. Confirm dark background, visible label, and sticks to the top on scroll.
3. Remove the scratch mount before committing.

## 4. `LifeGallery.tsx`

1. Open `/careers` → Life-at-TechGrit section: confirm a new "Inside TechGrit" badge (no dot).
2. Open `/` → Life-at-TechGrit section: confirm two action buttons now render.
3. Confirm both sections' photo grids, headings, and existing eyebrow are otherwise unchanged.

## 5. Gate check

1. `npm run lint` and `npm run build` — both green.
2. Diff should touch only: `components/ui/Button.tsx`, `components/ui/FilterBar.tsx` (new),
   `components/ui/section-eyebrow.tsx`, `app/_home-components/LifeGallery.tsx`, `app/tokens.css`,
   `app/globals.css` (only the new `@theme inline` token mappings) — plus the `reusable-components/`
   → `components/ui/` relocation of `section-eyebrow.tsx`, `final-cta.tsx`, `ambient-orbs.tsx`,
   `reveal-on-scroll.tsx` and the resulting import-path updates in their 23 consumers (already done).
